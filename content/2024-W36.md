##### Section in Textbook:

_Chapter:_ 4  
_Page Numbers:_ Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4

##### Key Concepts:

- **Concept 1: Free Fall**  
    Free fall is the motion of an object where the only force acting upon it is gravity.
    
- **Concept 2: Kinematic Equations**  
    The kinematic equations describe motion in a straight line with constant acceleration.
    
- **Concept 3: Newton's Second Law**  
    Applying Newton's Second Law in motion with constant acceleration shows that force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma).
    

##### Definitions:

- **Term 1: Free Fall**  
    The motion of a body where the only force acting upon it is gravity.
    
- **Term 2: Displacement**  
    The change in position of an object in a straight line.
    
- **Term 3: Kinematic Equations**  
    Mathematical equations that describe the motion of an object under constant acceleration.
    

##### Equations:

- **Equation 1:**
$$
v=v0+atv = v_0 + atv=v0+at
$$
(Final velocity = Initial velocity + Acceleration ×\times× Time).

- **Equation 2:**
$$
x=x0+v0t+12at2x = x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}at^2x=x0+v0t+21at2
$$
(Position = Initial position + Initial velocity ×\times× Time + 12\frac{1}{2}21 Acceleration ×\times× Time2^22).

##### Example Problems:

- **Problem 1:**  
    _Given:_ An object in free fall from rest.  
    _Find:_ Velocity after 5 seconds.  
    _Solution:_ Use
$$
v=v0+atv = v_0 + atv=v0+at
$$
with
$$
v_0 = 0, \ a = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2, \ t = 5 \, \text{s}$$ So,
$$
v = 9.8 \times 5 = 49 , \text{m/s}.
$$
- **Problem 2:** _Given: _ A car accelerates from rest at $$ (3m/s^2)$$ for 10 seconds.
  Find:_ Distance traveled. 
  _Solution:_ Use
$$
x = x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}at^2
$$
with
$$
x_0 = 0, \ v_0 = 0, \ a = 3 , \text{m/s}^2, \ t = 10
$$
The result is
$$
x = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 10^2 = 150 , \text{m}.
$$
##### Notes:  
- **Insight 1:** Free fall acceleration near the surface of Earth is approximately \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). 
- **Insight 2:** Kinematic equations are essential for calculating displacement, velocity, and acceleration. 
- **Insight 3:** Newton's Second Law relates force and acceleration, providing a foundational principle for motion analysis.
